Todo do next:

Here is what needs to happen:

For each tag:
- create needed functionality, idk what (render or load ejs or smth)

For each component in the AST:
[x] check tag is actually present and connect it with that component
[x] fill in tag arguments && validate present ones
[x] handle string attributes (amt)
- add render_self function

Create rendering obj
- find imports and sort them
- util function

Render

The import attributes in in test.md i.e. import css or js
